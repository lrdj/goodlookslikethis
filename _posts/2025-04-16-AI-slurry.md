  Up's opening sequence, is a ten minute-long movie in itself that tells the story of Seventy years, that wraps itself around characterisation, and love. Also, film + emotion...

This really touched me so I left a comment which I thought I'd keep here for later:-)

Hey Sanni:-) 

I so desperately want to agree with you. 

Dad was a director and as a teenager I learned how to load ArriBL and Éclair Cameflex magazines, built a darkroom, including using abandoned hamster cage bottoms as trays and a 35mm slide projector from the 1960s (it was in the loft) as an enlarger (involved quite a bit of carpentry). I kept going for years on pure passion...

"Sweat doubt and joy" are so real. 

I remember countless nights parked outside Metro E6 Labs in Chelsea waiting for clip tests, the extremes of joy and desperation when the results came out...

But, where we are now feels more like DoPs not wanting to shoot on video. The dynamic range eventually caught up and that's no longer an issue. 

The essence is some kid grabbing whatever cheap film-making solution is available and carving out a story, painting that emotion. If I look at the film you shared, I don't see a depth that's absent in films by AI video users. At least not as much as I was expecting when I read your post. 

I guess I need to see where this goes a bit further before taking a view. I suspect this isn't going to be an either/or, but instead that some people are driven by creative demons while others are not?
