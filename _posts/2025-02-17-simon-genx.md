Recruiters have gone into stealth mode. Most of you don’t even realise it.

We’ve stopped using job ads. They’re broken.
One software engineering role gets 300+ applications.

9 out of 10 are “Easy Apply” clicks from people who never read the description. People from the other side of the world. 

So we changed the playbook.

Yes we use our own CRMs but mostly we live inside LinkedIn Recruiter.

We search for you directly.
We scan your profile for maybe 3–5 seconds.

We know exactly what good looks like, then we either 

✅ Message
Or 
❌ Move on

And you’ll never know we were there. No profile view. No trace. Nothing, nada! 

If your profile doesn’t hit hard in those 3 seconds, you’re toast. 

And in a market where 70% of jobs never even get posted, that’s killing your chances big time. 

What makes us stop scrolling? Good question! 

1. Crystal-clear headline
❌ “Software Engineer at TechCorp”
✅ “Senior Backend Engineer | Python & AWS | Scaling fintech platforms for 10M+ users”

2. Professional photo
Clear, current, solo. No group shots. No blurry selfies, nothing weird. Head and a shoulders, smile ☺️

3. Backdrop that says something about who you are:
Company logo, conference stage, branded graphic. Your rock climbing or salsa dancing obsession. Just not a stock beach photo. 


Where this matters most
Tech (especially Ldr roles)
Sales
Marketing
Product management
Data and analytics

Red flags that kill your chances 🚩

No updates in 6 months
Headline that’s just a job title
Zero activity or posts
Incomplete experience
Old photo from another era

How you’ll know it’s working?

🟡 Recruiters start messaging you out of nowhere
🟡 More connection requests get accepted
🟡More connection requests recieved from recruiters

Bottom line👇🏻

The best jobs never hit a job board. They get filled by people who show up sharp and searchable, especially in the ‘leadership layer’. 

So, your LinkedIn isn’t just an online CV anymore. It’s your 24/7 sales asset for the hidden market most candidates never see.

Get it? Good! 

My question to you is….What’s the one change you’ll change today to stand out in those first 3 seconds?
