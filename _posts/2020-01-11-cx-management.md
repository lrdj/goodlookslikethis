Hi, if you're here it might be because you've just had a chat with Dug at <a href="http://www.customerexperienceevent.com/">CEM</a> and pointed your device at the QR on my badge.

Really looking forward to the panel this afternoon. particularly looking forward to hearing from GiffGaff's Claire Kavanagh:-)
