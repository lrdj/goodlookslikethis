I'm reminded of an old ad for The Guardian. It talks about the importance of perspective (sound on please).

Teaching my son to play chess I kept repeating 

> you need to see the whole board,

and this feels like such a great example of the importance of understanding the whole ecosystem.

My current thinking on this is of course, that the epic, pyramid-building scale required to re-tool and re-shape the whole organisation is waaaay out of scope of the average service design project. There will be multiple orgs, multiple stakeholders, politics, budgets etc. which make attempting to fix everything at once just silly...

What really *should* always be in scope from a service design perspective is telling the story of how it could all fit together.
