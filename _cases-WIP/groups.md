# Envisioning the Future of Adviser Services Post-Merger  

## Context  
Following the acquisition of **Pension Platform Provider** by **Trad Pension Provider** (part of **Large Banking Group**), leadership teams faced increasing challenges in aligning **product strategy, proposition design, and adviser service delivery**. While the merger had clear financial and operational benefits on paper, the execution of a **cohesive adviser strategy** remained unclear, leading to friction between teams and an emerging need for **strategic foresight**.

As part of my role in **Trad Pension Provider’s Adviser Lab**, I was approached to lead a **brief futures programme** with leadership teams from both organisations to help **map the post-merger landscape, align product and service strategies, and explore future opportunities for adviser relationships and digital service delivery**.

---

## Objectives  
1. **Clarify how the new adviser strategy might be delivered** across the combined organisation.  
2. **Explore potential futures** and steps required to get there.  
3. **Align leadership vision** on what an optimal adviser experience should look like.  
4. **Create actionable outputs** that could drive research, proposition development, and long-term strategy.  

---

## Approach  
To structure the engagement, I designed a **two-phase strategic foresight sprint**, leveraging a mix of **workshops, ecosystem mapping, and speculative design exercises**.

### Phase 1: Making Sense of the Current Landscape  
- Delivered **lightning talks** to leadership on foresight methodologies, industry trends, and competitor benchmarks.  
- Facilitated **as-is mapping of adviser services** using a "service stack" format to capture pain points, opportunities, and potential leverage points.  
- Conducted **initial research synthesis**, bringing together internal strategy documents from digital, tech, and product teams to align narratives.  

### Phase 2: Exploring Possible Futures  
- Ran a **strategic foresight sprint**, guiding teams through speculative exercises to explore different future states of the **adviser-LBG relationship**.  
- Identified a **"candidate future experience"**, which became a shared reference point for leadership to align around.  
- Created **prototype narratives and visual mockups** to articulate how a differentiated, future-ready adviser service could be positioned in the market.

## Key Findings & Actions Taken  
From the **August/September 2024 strategy sessions**, we identified four key actions to drive forward momentum:  

### 1) Accelerate qualitative research with advisers  
- Adviser Lab research team coordinated a **panel and in-depth research initiative** to uncover **real needs, constraints, and opportunities** within the adviser ecosystem.  
- Leadership committed to integrating these insights into the broader strategy.  

### 2) Map the as-is adviser service ecosystem  
- I led **initial service mapping** workshops with key stakeholders.  
- Conducted a **site visit to Pension Platform Provider HQ**, mapping existing teams and processes onto the **new service blueprint**.  
- Work paused temporarily to prioritize foresight activities.  

### 3) Define and document the delivery strategy  
- I collaborated with the **CPO of Trad Pension Provider** to refine the **"how we deliver"** section of the adviser strategy.  
- Reviewed **multiple digital and group tech strategy documents**, working towards an integrated narrative.  
- Next step: **Synthesize and connect insights** into a clear, actionable roadmap.  

### 4) Run a strategic foresight sprint  
- The sprint produced a **candidate future adviser experience**, aligning leadership around a **shared vision**.  
- High-level artefacts were created to support **ongoing proposition and service development**.  
- Awaiting feedback from leadership on potential **further exploration or additional design assets**.

## Impact & Next Steps  
This strategic foresight initiative provided leadership with:  
✔ A **structured way to envision the future** of adviser services within the newly merged entity.  
✔ **Clarity on key service and proposition challenges**, and a **pathway to resolve them**.  
✔ A **shared vision for the adviser experience**, reducing friction between teams and aligning priorities.  
✔ A **blueprint for action**, ensuring research, proposition work, and strategic alignment continue in a cohesive direction.  

The next steps will depend on how leadership chooses to build on this work—whether through **deepening foresight activities, expanding design research, or iterating on the future vision**. Either way, this initiative laid the groundwork for **a more unified, strategically aligned approach to the future of adviser services** within the newly combined organisation.
