It's hard to work somewhere when you don't feel a strong sense of purpose. Equally, it gets you drunk with hope and belief to work somewhere the mission is clear and strong.

I've been researching statements of purpose from senior digital folk and came across this one from WPP:

> To develop and manage talent; <br>
> to apply that talent, throughout the world, for the benefit of clients; <br>
> to do so in partnership; <br>
> to do so with profit

Not sure about the way it scans, but put another way, if Martin Sorrel's network of companies didn't exist there would be less developed and well-managed talent in the world. While I don't see empirical evidence of that, it's a strong statement and one I can get behind:-)

Incidentally, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Sorrel in the ballroom of the Pierre on E61st in Manhattan when he announced his takeover of my employer's parent company (JWT) to the assembled troops. I've had a thing ever since and actually ended up in the UK because IBM didn't think they should keep their business with us after the merger.

But that's another story...
