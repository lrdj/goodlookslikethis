1. Impact and measurability
2. Working in complexity
3. End-to-end design process
4. Governance and design assurance
5. Collaboration and constructive challenge


## Impact and measurability
Did your work move customer experience metrics (e.g. NPS, CSAT, task success, error rates)? Did it also deliver commercial or operational outcomes? They want proof you design for measurable impact, not just aesthetics.

## Working in complexity
How you navigated a knotty, multi-stakeholder environment (legal, compliance, risk, engineering, product, business lines). Theyâ€™ll want to see that you can translate constraints into design opportunities rather than getting blocked.

## End-to-end design process
Discovery â†’ research â†’ concepts â†’ prototyping â†’ usability testing â†’ design assurance â†’ launch â†’ post-launch. Theyâ€™ll expect you to show that you can carry work through the full lifecycle, not just one phase.

## Governance and design assurance
How you secured sign-off (feasibility, legal, risk, compliance), how you de-risked decisions early, and how you kept quality intact.

## Collaboration and constructive challenge
They want senior designers who influence and improve ways of working. Show that you didnâ€™t just execute, you also aligned people, challenged assumptions, and nudged culture/product practice forward.
