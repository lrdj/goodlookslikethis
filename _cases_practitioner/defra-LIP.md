  The Livestock Information programme (LIP) had been running for a little over two years when I joined the team to lead the design of the service. Lots of work had been done, but nothing had been delivered yet, and passing Beta assessment did not seem like a possibility.

### The Challenge

Navigating through a scenario where talented professionals were siloed in their expertise and lacked a coherent, uniting framework and strategy, especially amidst the divergent work-streams of IT, data, policy, and design. The notable absence of an organized process to morph insights into actionable initiatives further complicated the journey from research to delivery.

### The Role I Played

As the Service Design Lead, I became the connective tissue that unified diverse professional minds, acting as a strategic advisor, influencer, mentor, and hands-on guide across all facets of the design and development process.

### How I Did It

I employed a multifaceted approach, intertwining strategic leadership with hands-on mentoring and knowledge transfer. By implementing a clear, communicated strategy through a ‘tube map’ and guiding through a methodical ‘double-diamond’ design process, I ensured the journey from divergent ideas to converged, actionable prototypes and MVP was coherent and strategic.


### The project in a bit more detail

In the deeper dive section below the fold, you can delve into the nitty-gritty of each activity and strategy employed, perhaps elaborating on specific challenges and breakthrough moments within each phase of the ‘double-diamond’ design process, showcasing actual prototypes, and detailing the final MVP specifications. This section can also highlight the methodologies used in workshops, research techniques employed, and nuances of the agile ceremonies designed, providing a comprehensive view into your expertise and approach towards complex service design and delivery.
