## Project situation

This is one of those projects where things went strangely (starting in the wrong place, most of the work was done at 3am) but ended up with fabulous results. The challenge from the client was how to promote the uptake by their customers' employees of company pensions.

  My pitch introduced the idea of the "social IFA", a concept born out of the insight that people no longer trusted banks. This solution made use of an advanced Sitecore personalisation solution. 
</p>


My approach was to analyse the market and consumer base, identify the most useful insights and then turn those insights into proposed experiences that would deliver the required uptake.

## Action and outcomes

I was the creative director leading the pitch. I worked with planners and researchers, created the concepts and their UX then briefed Ul a Visual designer. I was running a young agency and pitching against a top-5 creative powerhouse
so was super desperate to impress. On the day the client preferred our work, so happy team:-)
